# Templater
A python project that allows the user to create one or more templates and produce an output folder according to a config file.

I created this project to make it easier for me to generate my dotfiles for Linux. I have multiple systems, which means each config file will be slightly different on all my machines, but there are many similarities that I want to be parallel between my systems (such as keybinds). Thus, this project was born.
